## Getting the project:

To get the project folder you need to clone the project. Note, that 

> **IMPORTANT**: This project uses Git Large Files Support (FLS).
Downloading a zip file using the green button Github will not work. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS. You can download Git LFS here: https://git-lfs.github.com/.

The project size is about 1.2 GB (size of Library folder) Your cloned repository will be almost double that due to git state. If it is much smaller, you most likely did not have LFS when you cloned.

Once you have cloned the repository, you should install the version of Unity that is listed above in the prerequisites section. Make sure you include windows standalone support in your installiation.
